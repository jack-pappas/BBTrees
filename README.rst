An F# implementation of weight-balanced binary trees.

This code has been ported directly from Stephen Adams' Standard ML (SML) code accompanying
his paper, `"Implementing Sets Efficiently in a Functional Language"`_. Eventually, I'll add some
F#-specific optimizations for better performance and make changes as necessary to adhere to
F# style guidelines.
